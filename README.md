### Best Customer:

- **Identified the customer who spent the most, recognizing them as the best customer based on total spending.**
 
## Techniques and SQL Concepts Used
- **Aggregation and Grouping:**
Used functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and GROUP BY to calculate metrics such as total invoices per country and revenue by city.

- **Sorting and Ranking:**
Applied ORDER BY clauses to rank results by totals and determine the top-performing entities.

- **Limiting Results:**
Leveraged LIMIT to focus on specific results, such as the top invoice totals and highest-spending customer.

- **Filtering Data:**
Utilized conditional statements to refine data selection.
